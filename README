# Reinvented Looper
This is a module for PDB protein structures loop modeling that is deemed as a **reinvent-the-wheel** effort.
For a given PDB structure with gaps/loops in the chain, this tool will query PDB for the residue sequence and fill in the gap/loop region with the residues coordinates from homology models.

This tool requires Biopython and its strucuture alignment routine. No other sophisticated algorithmns involved, just a naive solution for the problem.
