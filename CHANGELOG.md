## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `test` extra: `pip install crimm[test]` installs pytest for running the test suite.

### Changed

- `RDKitHetConverter.load_heterogen` warns instead of raising `TypeError` when given a residue
  that is not a `Heterogen`, such as one read from a CRD file.

### Fixed

- `heterogen_to_rdkit` no longer raises `AttributeError` on a residue without
  `pdbx_description`, such as one read from a CRD file.
